Generic Python2 vs Python3 reassembler

diff reassembler2.py reassembler3.py

most of the changes seem be be fairly standard
some invlove adding extra error checking for None and returning false
some are from moving towards the python3 way of doing things
    xrange() -> range
some seem to be about making the platform more concise
    bits / 8 -> bytes
some are changes in the calls to methods or accessing data

many occurrences of differences between 2 vs 3 seem harmless
    changes about logging
    unicode escapes
    how to get the next label
