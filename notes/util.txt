The program 'arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi

fatal error: config.h: No such file or directory
sudo apt-get install libconfig-dev

gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi
xz-utils

download the source and configure to cross compile with make

./configure --build x86_64-pc-linux-gnu --host arm-linux-gnueabi LDFLAGS="-static"
make


1. The compile issues a warning that a certain function
could be modified for improved performance.
2. The build process treats all warnings as errors.

This typically happens when one builds coreutils
directly from the git repository.

It should never happen when building from an official tarball.


If you are building from git (e.g. "git clone
git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils.git") and still want to proceed, you can
disable these warnings like so:

git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/coreutils.git
cd coreutils
./bootstrap
./configure --disable-gcc-warnings
make
